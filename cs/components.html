          <p>The <b>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</b> carries out arithmetic and logical operations on data. The results of its calculations are stored in the <b>accumulator</b>.</p>
          <p>The <b>Control Unit (CU)</b> decodes instructions, sends signals to co-ordinate the operations of the processor, synchronises the flow of data around the CPU, and manages the execution of instructions.</p>
          <p>The <b>Program Counter (PC)</b> stores the address of the next instruction to be executed. Its value is sent to the <b>MAR</b> and is then incremented by one.</p>
          <p>The <b>Accumulator (ACC)</b> stores the results of calculations carried out by the <b>ALU</b>.</p>
          <p>The <b>Memory Address Register (MAR)</b> stores the address of the next location in memory to be read from or written to, e.g. the address of the next instruction, copied from the <b>PC</b>.</p>
          <p>The <b>Memory Data Register (MDR)</b> temporarily holds data that has been read from / is to be written to main memory, acting as a buffer, e.g. stores the instruction held at the address specified in the <b>MAR</b> (copied from the <b>PC</b>), and copies it to the <b>CIR</b>.</p>
          <p>The <b>Current Instruction Register (CIR)</b> holds the instruction currently being decoded / executed. The instruction is split into an <b>opcode</b> (what operation to carry out) and an <b>operand</b> (the data / the location of the data to carry out the operation on).</p>
          <p>A <b>bus</b> is a set of parallel wires connecting two or more components of a computer.</p>
          <p>The <b>data bus</b> carries data between the processor and main memory. It is bi-directional.</p>
          <p>The <b>address bus</b> carries the address of the memory location being read from or written to.</p>
          <p>The <b>control bus</b> transmits control signals from the <b>CU</b> to synchronise / manage the operations of the processor.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="bg-light p-5 rounded">
          <p>The stages of the <b>fetch-decode-execute (FDE) cycle</b> are:</p>
          <p><b>Fetch:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>The address of the next instruction is copied from the <b>PC</b> to the <b>MAR</b>.</li>
            <li>The address of the next instruction is placed on the <b>address bus</b> and the <b>CU</b> instructs a memory read operation.</li>
            <li>The instruction stored at that address is transferred from main memory to the processor via the <b>data bus</b>, and stored in the <b>MDR</b>.</li>
            <li>Simultaneously, the contents of the <b>PC</b> are incremented by one, so that it contains the address of the next instruction to be fetched.</li>
            <li>The contents of the <b>MDR</b> are copied to the <b>CIR</b>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Decode:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>The <b>CU</b> decodes the instruction held in the <b>CIR</b>.</li>
            <li>The instruction is split into an <b>opcode</b>, to determine the type of instruction, and an <b>operand</b>, to determine what data to carry the operation out on. Any additional data (if needed) is fetched from main memory.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Execute:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>The appropriate instruction is carried out on the <b>operand</b>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The cycle is then repeated.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="bg-light p-5 rounded">
          <p>The <b>clock</b> produces electric signals, oscillating between 0 and 1, to synchronise the operations of the processor. All processor activities begin on a clock pulse (although may take more than one clock cycle to complete). So, the higher the <b>clock speed</b> (the number of clock cycles per second), the faster instructions can be executed.</p>
          <p>Theoretically, each <b>core</b> of a CPU is able to process a different instruction simultaneously. So, roughly speaking, the higher the <b>number of cores</b>, the more instructions the processor can execute at once, and so the more efficient it is.</p>
          <p>However, doubling the number of cores does not double the speed; time must be spent organising which core receives which data and instructions, and the performance of a multi-core processor depends on the nature of a required task (whether or not it is possible to split a task into subtasks that can be processed in parallel).</p>
          <p>Multi-core processors can be used for multitasking - different cores can run different applications.</p>
          <p><b>Cache</b> is a small amount of very fast memory in the CPU which stores frequently used data and instructions.</p>
          <p>Accessing data from <b>cache</b> is much quicker than from RAM, so the <b>larger the cache</b>, the more instructions will be fetched from <b>cache</b> instead of RAM, and so the quicker the processor.</p>
          <p>There are different levels of <b>cache</b>; level 1 is the fastest, but the smallest, and level 3 is the slowest, but the largest. The <b>faster the cache</b>, the quicker data / instructions can be fetched, increasing the speed / efficiency of the processor.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="bg-light p-5 rounded">
          <p>With <b>pipelining</b>, whilst one instruction is being executed, another can be decoded, and another can be fetched. This allows instructions to be executed more quickly, improving processor performance.</p>
          <p>However, programs that involve lots of branching may not benefit from <b>pipelining</b> so much, since the wrong instructions may be fetched or decoded, meaning the pipeline would need to be <b>flushed</b>.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="bg-light p-5 rounded">
          <p>In <b>von Neumann architecture</b>, both data and instructions are stored in the same memory unit, and are accessed using the same bus.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, in <b>Harvard architecture</b>, data and instructions are held in separate memory units, and are accessed using different buses.</p>
